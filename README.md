# SuperSimpleServer
Just a super simple server using HTTPListener to listen and StreamReader with Context to serve </br> </br>
**NOTE:** Soon flipping this to GO because I *need* to be one of the cool kids :sunglasses:

## What is this?
Nothing that hasn't been done a million different times a million different ways: a super simple server for listening at a specified address for requests and then serving up flat files from the root directory.

## Why is this?
A fun little project for myself to discover the joys of server-side logic by starting at the smallest point and walking out from there!

## How is this?
By using the most simple, basic, and "batteries included" listener, reader, and sender modules to trasmit file information from one point to another via HTTP.
That is: a super simple server!
